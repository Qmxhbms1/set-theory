\begin{problem}
  Show that $\Gamma (\alpha \times \alpha) \le \omega^{\alpha}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  We will use induction.
  The claim trivially holds for $0$.
  If the theorem holds for $\alpha$, we will consider $\alpha + 1$.
  We have $\Gamma(\alpha + 1 \times \alpha + 1) = \Gamma(\alpha \times \alpha) + \alpha \cdot 2 + 1$, as we know that the amount of pairs with $max(\xi, \eta) = \alpha$ is $\alpha + \alpha + 1$.
  By the inductive hypothesis and using the easily proven fact that $1 \le \alpha \le \omega^{\alpha}$ we get
  \[\Gamma(\alpha + 1 \times \alpha + 1) \le \omega^{\alpha} + \omega^{\alpha} + \omega^{\alpha} + \omega^{\alpha} = \omega^{\alpha} \cdot 4 < \omega^{\alpha} \cdot \omega = \omega^{\alpha + 1}.\]
  Thus we have proven the induction on the successor ordinals.
  If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal and we assume the statement holds for all preceding ordinals then by continuity of $\Gamma$ we have
  \[\Gamma(\alpha \times \alpha) = \bigcup \Gamma(\beta \times \beta) \le \bigcup \omega^{\beta} = \omega^{\alpha}.\]
  This concludes the proof.
